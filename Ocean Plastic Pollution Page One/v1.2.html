                        <h1> How is plastic made? </h1>
                        <p> 
                        Plastics can be either synthetic or bio-based. Synthetic plastics 
                        are derived from fossil fuels like crude oil and natural gas, while 
                        bio-based plastics are made from renewable 
                        biological sources such as starches, sugars, and vegetable oils.
                        Plastic manufacturing involves various processes, often 
                        requiring precise control of temperature and pressure.
                        </p>
                        <p> 
                        One common method is casting, where a mold is first coated with 
                        a release agent and sometimes preheated. A thermosetting resin, 
                        typically mixed with a curing agent, is poured into the mold. 
                        The resin then undergoes curing—either chemically or with heat—until 
                        it solidifies. Once set, the mold is opened, and the part is removed. 
                        Any excess material, such as sprues, is trimmed or sanded off.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Although there are many methods of plastic processing—such as 
                        injection molding, extrusion, and blow molding—casting remains a versatile 
                        and cost-effective technique, especially for small production runs and complex shapes.

                            <h2> What is the reason behind such a surge in plastic production? </h2>
                            
                            <p>
                            One main reason for this high amount of plastic production per year is 
                            the global production of single-use plastics such as food packaging, bottles, 
                            and plastic containers. The mass production of plastics globally has been outpacing 
                            the development of robust waste management systems. Another big reason for this surge 
                            in plastic production is the inadequate waste management implemented by big waste 
                            management corporations, with a very small fraction of plastic waste actually being 
                            recycled whilst the rest is mismanaged, leading to the waste ending up in landfills,
                            incinerated, or simply released into the environment. It has been estimated that 
                            we will have more plastics in our oceans than fish by the year 2050.

                        <p>
                        Humans produce more than 400,000,000 metric tons of plastic every 
                        year, which is about the weight of every single human on the planet. 
                        However, only 0.5% of all that plastic enters the ocean, making the weight 
                        of plastic that goes into our oceans 2,000,000 metric tons. The rising levels 
                        of plastic have been projected to grow over time, according to a recent study by 
                        an environmental research association.

                                                products, leading to their release into landfills or natural environments. 
                                                Some researchers suggest that by 2050 there could be more plastic than fish

                                                mistake indigestible plastic waste for food and die of starvation as their
